/*
The poinbt is, I need something that controls the flow of the game, this is, 
that stops the game when there is an animation, or a menu is open. One solution
is to make different rooms for every stage, but i prefer to keep everything in 
place. Another way is to activate/inactivate instances. A third option is 
to create a var that allows or not acces to certain functions in every 
instance.
