/*
Actors follow the rules dictated by object_script
They do nothing but visual things like moving, speaking, etc.
They have an array where every gesture is stored, so in case they have to 
show any emotion it is possible by specificating which sprite to show.
They also have the constants and methods to do stuff, so that object scripts 
only have to trigger them.
